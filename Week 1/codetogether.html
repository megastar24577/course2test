	<p>The game is set in the fictional Norvinsk region, where a war is taking place between two private military companies (United Security "USEC" and the Battle Encounter Assault Regiment "BEAR"). Players join matches in which they fight other players for loot and aim to survive and escape; dying results in the loss of almost all items the player used and found during that game.</p>
